FARELY: A fare-focused budget tracker

A mobile fare-tracking application developed to help students and workers
manage their daily transportation expenses. 

What problem does it want to address? 

Transportation costs, especially for fares (such as jeepneys) 
are often overlooked in overall budget tracking. 

The app aims to address the common challenge of tracking fares manually or relying on memory. 
Farely simplifies fare monitoring by offering users tools to record commutes, 
set weekly or monthly budgets, and review summarized expenses.

Prototype was built using Figma, a cloud-based design and prototyping platform.
